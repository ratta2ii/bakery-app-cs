### **Description**

_This is a console application built in C#. The application uses 2 seperarte classes; One to run the program and the second class for the backend logic. When a user runs the application they should be welcomed to the bakery and asked both how many pastries they would like, and how many loaves of bread they would like to order. A user should be able to specify how many of both pastries and loaves of bread they would like to order. The application will then return a grand total to the user for the costs of the items._
#
_The  Deli is currently offering both of these discounts._
* Bread: Buy 2, get 1 free. A single loaf costs $5.
* Pastry: Buy 1 for \$2 or 3 for $5.
